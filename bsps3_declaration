Scientific: 
The scientific question answered in this project will be: How to detect if a
password file is in possession of intruders and at the same time prevent
phishing attacks? First of all this paper goes into technologies used to alarm
the system administrator if an attacker has unauthorized access to the password
file. Afterwards it covers into how this is combined with PAKE (Password Access
Key Exchange) to prevent phising attacks.


Technical: 
The technical part will be a system that alarms the system administrator of
potential attackers being in possession of the password file. It uses the
technical properties picked up by the scientific part. The project will be
written in python and it will implement PAKE that ensures further security for
the password file to prevent for example phishing attacks.
